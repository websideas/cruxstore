YITH WooCommerce Brands Add-on allows you to show brands in your store that are for online customers a very important additional reason for reliability.


== Description ==

Showing known brands in your shop has many advantages both for you and for your customers, especially in an online store, where quality cannot be "touched" and a product might be easily under- or overestimated. Not only do well known brands attract customers and grant you more visibility, but your customers will feel much more confident when buying, because the brand itself is a guarantee of quality. Leaving aside the possibility to keep prices high and all other benefits that we cannot list here, now you can add this simple but powerful feature to your shop wiht YITH WooCommerce Brands Add-On.
